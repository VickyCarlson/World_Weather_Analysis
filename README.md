# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of the project was to use APIs to analyze worldwide weather to determine the best vacation spots. The weather was analyzed for a minimum temperature of 70 degrees and a maximum temperature of 90 degrees. An itinerary of four cities meeting these criteria was created and a map with flags for the hotel, city and temperature to show the itinerary between the four locations was created.
